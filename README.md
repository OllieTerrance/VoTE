The Vote-oriented Tally Engine (shortened to 'VoTE') is an interesting new (well, not really) concept.  It will ask you a variety of questions, designed to test what kind of person you are.  There are no right or wrong answers here (although some questions clearly have right and wrong answers) - just vote for what you like.  :)
